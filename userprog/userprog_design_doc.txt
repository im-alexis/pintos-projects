---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: Briefly describe how you implemented argument parsing.  How do
>> you arrange for the elements of argv[] to be in the right order?

    We allocate a new page, then copy file_name into the new page.
    Next we create a hard copy of the file_name parameter into file_name_cpy
    Then, we use strtok_r() to get the file name (which is the first element of the input param)
    Next, we create a new thread to execute FILE_NAME, add it to the parent list (mis_ninos), and eventually start the process. 
    In start_process, we call the load function which is where the rest of the argument parsing begins. 
    In load we use strtok_r to save the first argument.
    Then we go into a while loop in which the condition is such that if strtok_r() returns NULL, so that it can tokenize 
    the rest of the input param and put them into our args array.

>> How do you avoid overflowing the stack page?
    We limit the arguments to those that will fit in a single page. 
    We also malloc when neccessary and are planning on freeing any unused data, such as when a remove is being called



---- RATIONALE ----

>> A3: Why does Pintos implement strtok_r() but not strtok()?
    strtok_r() is thread safe while strtok is not(). (its a dafety precaution we take)

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> B1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or
>> `struct' member, global or static variable, `typedef', or
>> enumeration.  Identify the purpose of each in 25 words or less.

static struct lock file_lock;   /* Lock for synchronization on file related operations */

>> B2: Describe how file descriptors are associated with open files.
>> Are file descriptors unique within the entire OS or just within a
>> single process?

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B3: Describe your code for reading and writing user data from the
>> kernel.

SYS_READ:
We start by validating the argument pointers. If the pointers are not valid, the function returns. 
Then, we set the fd to the first arg, *buffer to second arg, and the size to the third arg.
Next we check that the buffer contains valid pointers to data for the indicated size (arg1).
Then we check that fd table (ensures it is not reading from STDOUT and is less than the MAX_FD)
Once we finish the validations, we set 'file' to the specified fd from from the current threads' file_descriptor_table
If the file is NULL, we exit. If not, we acquire the file lock, set the file_write for the fdt to deny, run process_execute, the release the lock. We set the frames eax to the return value. 

SYS_WRITE
We validate the pointers and buffers and set the fd, *buffer, and size variables to args0, arg1, and arg2, respectively.
Next we check that we are not reading from STDIN and the fd is less than MAX_FD - if they are, it exits the current thread and sets the return value to -1. 
Then we check that if we are writing to the console (STDOUT). If we are, we use the file lock, run putbuf to write to the console, release the lock, then set the frames return value to size.
Finally, in the case that it passes all validation and is not writing to the console, we set the 'targeta' file variable to the specified fd from the current thread's file_descriptor_table
We then use this to verify that targeta is not equal to NULL, acquire the file_lock, open the current executing file and load it into the '*exec_file' file pointer, and release the file_lock
Then we check if the file is trying to write to the executable file; if it is, we close the file and exit. 
Otherwise, we acquire/release the lock while we close the exec_file. Then we acquire the file lock and re-enable targeta's write operation. If the targeta's deny_write is false, then we run file_write on targeta from 'buffer' of 'size'.
We then disable file_write to targeta, and release the lock.

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

---- RATIONALE ----

>> B9: Why did you choose to implement access to user memory from the
>> kernel in the way that you did?

Because the standford doc/ reciatation said it was easier of the two operations.
It is more straightforward logically to get the test out of the way to begin with.


>> B10: What advantages or disadvantages can you see to your design
>> for file descriptors?
Disadvantages:

There exist many duplicate file descriptor structs, for stdin and stdout - 
each thread contains structs for these fds. Worst case: acessing a file descriptor 
is O(n), where n is the number of file descriptors for the current thread and we 
obviously would need to run through the entire fd list. Best case it could be 
O(1) if they were stored in an array.

Advantages: 
Because each thread has a list of its file descriptors, there is no limit on 
the number of open file descriptors (until we run out of memory). Whether we use 
pipe or open our file descriptors are created, the same structure can store the 
necessary information, and be used in essentially the same way.




>> B11: The default tid_t to pid_t mapping is the identity mapping.
>> If you changed it, what advantages are there to your approach?

Did we change these??? Weset things as the default.

Answering these questions is optional, but it will help us improve the
course in future semesters.  Feel free to tell us anything you
want -- these questions are just to spur your thoughts.  You may also
choose to respond anonymously in the course evaluations at the end of
the semester.
